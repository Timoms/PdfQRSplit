# PdfQRSplit

*PdfQRSplit* is a small utility to split a multi-page PDF document into separate PDF files based on pages containing a specified barcode. This concept is known as "separator page" and used in combination with high volume document scanners to scan a large number of unrelated documents in bulk.

While named "*QR*" this tool will also work with most other barcode types.

## Installation and requirements

Python 3 or newer is required. 
Default library os used for file deletion.  
You also need **zxing** (Barcode recognition), **pypdf4** (PDF handling) and **pillow** (image handling) - all of them can be installed using pip:

```
pip install zxing pypdf4 pillow os
```

## Usage


| Argument | Description | Default | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| -h, --help | Show help message and exit | - | - |
| -p, --prefix <prefix\> | Prefix for generated PDF files | split | "splitted_pdf_" |
| -o, --output <path\> | Output path for generated files | . / | "/home/user/split/" |
| -s, --seperator <seperator\> | Barcode content used to find separator pages | ADAR-NEXTDOC | "DMS_SEPERATOR" |
| -rm, --remove-original <True/False\> | Remove original file after splitting | False | - |
| -k, --keep-page | Keep separator page in previous document | no | - |
| -kn, --keep-page-next | Keep separator page in next document | no | - |
| -b, --brightness <brightness\> | Brightness threshold for barcode preparation (0-255) | 128 | - |
| -v, --verbose | Show verbose processing messages | off | - |
| -d, --debug | Show debug messages | off | - |

```properties
PdfQRSplit.py [-h] [-p PREFIX] [-o OUTPUT] [-s SEPARATOR] [-rm REMOVE_ORIGINAL] [-k] [--keep-page-next] [-b BRIGHTNESS] [-v] [-d] inputfile
```

## Example

Take the file **input.pdf**, search all pages for barcodes containing the text *"SPLITME"*. If found (or at the end of the input file) previously encountered pages will be written to a separate file, in this case (-k) including the page containing the separator barcode. Since no prefix was given the first file will be named "*split_0_0.pdf*". *split* is the default prefix, 0 indicates it was generated from the first (and in this case only) input file and the second 0 indicates it's the first document extracted from this file.

You can use the PDF provided in the `examples` directory of this repo for a quick demonstration:

```console
foo@bar:~$ python .\PdfQRSplit.py .\examples\example.pdf -s "DMS_SEPERATOR" -v
Processing file .\examples\example.pdf containing 3 pages
  Analyzing page 1
  Analyzing page 2
  Analyzing page 3
  [...]
  Analyzing page 6
    Found separator - writing 6 pages to split_0_0.pdf
  Analyzing page 7
  [...]
  Analyzing page 13
    Found separator - writing 7 pages to split_0_1.pdf
  Analyzing page 14
  [...]
Split 1 given files into 19 files
```
